#Answers: First, when formulating the objective function,
#Each 𝑥𝑖𝑗 represents the amount of shipment from the source, plants 𝑖, to the destination, warehouse 𝑗, for 𝑖 = 1, 2 and 𝑗 = 1, 2, 3.

#I want to minimize total cost, which includes production cost + shipping cost.
#Production costs: Plant A: $600 per unit × number produced, Plant B: $625 per unit × number produced

#Then, Minimum Z = (600+22)𝑥A1 +(600+14)𝑥A2 + (600+30)𝑥A3 +(625+16)𝑥B1 + (625+20)𝑥B2 + (625+24)𝑥B3

#1.There are constraints from Supply side (i.e., production capacity)
#A1+ 𝑥A2+ 𝑥A3 ≤ 100 (which is the capacity of Plant A)
#B1+ 𝑥B2+ 𝑥B3 ≤ 120 (which is the capacity of Plant B)

#2.There are constraints from Demand side (i.e., monthly demand)
#A1+ 𝑥B1 =80 (demand of the warehouse 1)
#A2+ 𝑥B2 =60 (demand of the warehouse 2)
#A3+ 𝑥B3 =70 (demand of the warehouse 3)

#3.Non-negativity xij≥0

#next, when we solve this with R

```{r}
# Install lpSolve if not installed
# install.packages("lpSolve")

library(lpSolve)

# Cost matrix (production + shipping)
costs <- matrix(c(
  600+22, 600+14, 600+30,  # Plant A to W1,W2,W3
  625+16, 625+20, 625+24   # Plant B to W1,W2,W3
), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE)

# Supply (production capacity)
supply <- c(100, 120)

# Demand (warehouse)
demand <- c(80, 60, 70)

# Solve transportation problem
result <- lp.transport(
  cost.mat = costs,
  direction = "min",
  row.signs = rep("<=", 2), #plant side constraints
  row.rhs = supply,
  col.signs = rep("=", 3), #warehouse side constraints
  col.rhs = demand
)
```


```{r}
# Show optimal shipping plan
result$solution
```

```{r}

# Show total minimum cost
result$objval
```
#Answer: Minimum Total Cost: $132,790

#Explanation: Plant A produces 100 units and ships 60 to W2 and 40 to W3. Plant B produces 110 units and ships 80 to W1 and 30 to W3. All warehouse demands are met, and total production + shipping cost is minimized.
